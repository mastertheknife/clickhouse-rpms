# clickhouse-rpms
**Unofficial** ClickHouse RPMs for RHEL8\CentOS8.
Natively built on EL8 from a SPEC file and uses the OS libraries when possible and safe to do so. Requires the EPEL repository.

You can find the RPMs and the SRPMs here:
ClickHouse \*-stable versions: https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/mastertheknife:/clickhouse-stable/CentOS_8/
ClickHouse \*-lts versions: https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/mastertheknife:/clickhouse-lts/CentOS_8/
Please note that sometimes the LTS contains a newer version than the stable. For example, as of this writing, latest LTS is 21.3 and latest stable is 21.2.

I originally created these for my own use, but given the effort of creating it and maintaining it, its worth sharing :-)
The RPMs are built on OpenSUSE's excellent OBS (Open Build Service).
